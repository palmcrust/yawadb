YawADB configures a rooted Android device for wireless access through Android Debug Bridge (ADB) without using USB cable connection.

YawADB can be launched either as an app (all Android versions), or as a widget (Android 1.5+). It is designed to be self aware and keep the information current.

The application provides a number of customised features.
